                This website is intended to be a common, dynamic clearinghouse for information 
                regarding homelessness in our community and efforts to address it.  To help keep
                the information timely, accurate, and as complete as possible, PATH welcomes
                community members who have information to share it with us so that we can include
                it.  Contributors must register with the website in order to facilitate
                collaboration and review of content and to provide accountability.

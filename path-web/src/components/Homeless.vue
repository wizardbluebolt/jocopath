              <h2 class="pa-2">Facts about homelessness in Josephine County</h2>
              <p class="pa-4 text-h6">In the State of Oregon, there are estimated to be about 18,000 homeless people on a given night.
                This is an average rate of 42.4 homeless for every 10,000 people in the general population.  
                This rate is a slight decrease from the reported rate of 47.6 people per 10,000 population in 2007.
              </p>
              <p class="pa-4 text-h6">As of 2023, there are estimated to be over 600 homeless people in Grants Pass alone
                among its 38,000 residents, which is a rate of 63 homeless per 10,000 in the general population.  
                This is 50% higher than the reported state average, and double the rate estimated in 2007!</p>
              <p class="pa-4 text-h6">In the Medford, Ashland, and Jackson County area, there are estimated to be 1,250 homeless people on a given night, 
                which is an average of 56 people per 10,000 in the general population.  Medford has a very active low barrier shelter and more established
                set of services to help address the problem, which may help to explain its lower rate.
              </p>
              <p class="pa-4 text-h6">The median "fair market" monthly rental in Grants Pass in 2020 was reported to be $1,070 for a two-bedroom apartment ($12,840 per year).
                This was an increase from $955 per month in 2019.  </p>
              <p class="pa-4 text-h6">The median household income in 2020 was $46,580, meaning half of households have income less than this amount.  
                Rent accounts for 28% of the average household's budget.</p>
